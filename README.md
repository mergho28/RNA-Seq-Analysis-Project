# RNA-Seq-Analysis-Project
 This Shiny app provides an interactive pipeline for single-cell RNA-seq analysis using Seurat. Users upload an Excel file, and the app processes the data, normalizes it, identifies variable features, and creates a Seurat object. It generates a UMAP plot for cell clustering and a violin plot to visualize RNA feature distribution.
